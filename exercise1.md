In python, there are several linters like pylint, pydocstyle, and pycodestyle, that can take care of your syntax problems and some also help with stylistic issues. For testing there are also several options, like unittest, which is the one that comes integrated with python, nose, pytest and some come integrated in the framework you choose. For building, I found pybuilder, pyinfra and Scons.

There are multiple alternatives for Jenkins and Github Actions, like Gitlab, Attlassian Bamboo, Circle CI, Team City, Travis CI, BuildMaster, Buddy, Azure Pipelines, and a lot more of them.

To choose between self-hosted and cloud-based environment, we would need to know first what kind of app is the team building, and what kind of needs does the team need for its continuous development, whether it's a small app or a big app, we would lean between cloud-based and self-hosted, for smaller apps cloud based would be a decent option, while the team may need a self-hosted one if it's a big app. It's hard to choose if we are in between, so maybe if it needs to be made quickly going for cloud based is going to be easier, while self-hosted is harder to build, it is more rewarding in terms of speed and options.
